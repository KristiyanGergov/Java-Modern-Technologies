1 As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
2 It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .
4 Best indie of the year , so far .
3 Hatfield and Hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications .
1 It 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend .
2 That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .
2 The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
2 It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .
2 A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
1 While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .
1 The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen .
2 More vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it 's inoffensive and actually rather sweet .

3 As tricky and satisfying as any of David Mamet 's airless cinematic shell games .
1 I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , I do n't see the point .

4 Both lead performances are Oscar-size .
0 Run for your lives !
3 Mark Pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .
3 Claude Chabrol 's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements .
3 Transforms one of -LRB- Shakespeare 's -RRB- deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy .
1 The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
3 But arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us .
1 Its generic villains lack any intrigue -LRB- other than their funny accents -RRB- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
3 The characters are more deeply thought through than in most ` right-thinking ' films .
3 The film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun .
0 Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .
4 A smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : It gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic .
1 It 's like a drive-by .
3 is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it 's a love story as sanguine as its title .
3 A very funny romantic comedy about two skittish New York middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles .

1 The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character .
2 Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
1 This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
4 An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud .
3 All in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own .
3 Phillip Noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , Christopher Doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of Greene 's prose , and it 's there on the screen in their version of The Quiet American .

3 Writer\/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .
0 Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
4 Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion .

1 And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest .
0 The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
3 Whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us .

3 Winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars .
3 If Mostly Martha is mostly unsurprising , it 's still a sweet , even delectable diversion .
4 A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause .
3 Keenly observed and refreshingly natural , Swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in Myrtle Beach , S.C. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner .
2 A brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it .
4 A triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light .
1 Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
3 A fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction .

1 It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?
1 Daughter From Danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds .
4 One of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces .
4 Intriguing and downright intoxicating .
1 Although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film does n't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up Catholic or , really , anything .
0 The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
3 Sleek and arty .
0 Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
3 -LRB- Cho 's face is -RRB- an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots .
1 It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
2 Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .
3 It lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho .
1 Like the world of his film , Hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .
4 When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .
1 Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .
2 Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them , Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp through horror and hellish conditions .
1 It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
4 Spielberg 's realization of a near-future America is masterful .
0 There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
3 He 's one of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness .
1 Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
1 ... stale and uninspired .
3 In the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .
3 Has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke .
1 Eerily accurate depiction of depression .
1 As a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
3 An uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . '
1 The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
3 It 's the filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion .
2 As any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death .
2 You bet there is and it 's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking .
3 Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .
1 Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an -LRB- emotionally at least -RRB- adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .
0 Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
2 A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog .
2 Those who love Cinema Paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved .
3 Campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful .
0 Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
3 It 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects .
2 Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .
2 Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .
2 ... the one thing this Wild film has that other Imax films do n't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house .
0 Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
3 This is a children 's film in the truest sense .
0 Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
4 Beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing .
1 An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
1 The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
3 Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
3 Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made Mamet 's `` House of Games '' and last fall 's `` Heist '' so much fun .
3 The film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once .
2 At a brief 42 minutes , we need more X and less blab .
2 The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .
1 There 's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments .
3 Uneven but a lot of fun .
2 The result might look like Vulgar .
0 The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
3 The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire and you wo n't be disappointed .
1 It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
3 Manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state .
1 The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
2 Though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous .
1 The film can depress you about life itself .
1 If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
1 You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .
4 This is a superior horror flick .
2 The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
1 A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .
1 But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .
2 Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .
3 More sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... an amusing little catch .
1 Storytelling feels slight .
4 Monte Cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .

3 Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as -LRB- Jason Bourne -RRB- .
1 Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance .
3 When it 's this rich and luscious , who cares ?
1 A singularly off-putting romantic comedy .
2 Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .
0 Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .
1 A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .
3 An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .
1 Cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation -LRB- career - kids = misery -RRB- in tiresome romantic-comedy duds .
1 A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
3 His work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories .
1 An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .
0 Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .
1 The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
0 The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
1 They threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
0 It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
3 Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
2 Jolting into Charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -LRB- accurate ?
2 Or both .
2 Williams plays Sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in Insomnia .
1 Phoned-in business as usual .
1 With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
0 Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
0 Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
3 In an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , Narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve .
3 A rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hairs on your chest .
4 ... a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind .
4 Miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .

4 Provides the kind of ` laugh therapy ' I need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending .
0 Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
3 At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon .
2 Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .
3 Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .
4 This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .
1 Feral and uncomfortable .
4 Sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first -LRB- as best I remember -RRB- , but still a very good time at the cinema .
3 It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .
0 Black-and-white and unrealistic .
3 The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol .
0 The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .
3 Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .
1 Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
4 Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere .
3 A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .
3 Now as a former Gong Show addict , I 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .
3 Genuinely unnerving .
4 The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .
3 One of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .
2 A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .
1 Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .
4 Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .
1 One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .
3 In fact , even better .
2 ... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .
2 Proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie .
2 An uplifting , largely bogus story .
4 Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods .
4 Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
4 A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last .
3 After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing
1 It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
2 Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
1 Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .
1 Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
0 The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
2 A mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book .
0 Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
0 In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
0 A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '
1 First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
2 I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .
1 ... silly humbuggery ...
1 Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it .
3 A smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy .
0 -LRB- A -RRB- rather thinly-conceived movie .
3 Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .
4 Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .
3 A slight but sweet film .
2 Got a David Lynch jones ?
2 Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .
1 Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
4 `` Austin Powers in Goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end .
2 What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .
2 The filmmakers might want to look it up .
4 While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .
4 There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .
0 A dreary movie .
1 Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
1 To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
3 Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .
3 Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .
3 What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .
2 Buy popcorn .
2 A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
1 A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
2 -LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .
3 Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
4 Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .
1 Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
0 ... irritating soul-searching garbage .
3 A solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket .
2 Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .
0 In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .

1 Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .
1 Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '
2 With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .
1 It labours as storytelling .
1 Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
3 The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .
1 Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
2 ... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .
1 I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .
2 Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .
2 When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should come a-knocking , no ?
2 If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .

1 This is no `` Waterboy ! ''
2 They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .
2 The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .
2 Not as good as the original , but what is ...
4 Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give `` Scratch '' a second look .
3 Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable .
1 An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
0 Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
2 Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings .

2 Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .

4 Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and Heaven is one such beast .
4 Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .
4 Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misunderstood career .
1 Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .
1 ... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .
3 Nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` Memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` Requiem for a Dream . '
4 Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible .
0 Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .
0 This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
1 Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .
4 Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .
1 Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .
2 `` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .
4 Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .
3 The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Everyman is in the details .
1 The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
1 Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
3 Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .
2 In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .
4 As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .
3 Maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is .
2 Would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ?

3 Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .
2 A porn film without the sex scenes .
2 The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .
3 Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -
1 Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
3 `` Barbershop '' is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story .
1 A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .

4 It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .
1 The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .

1 As lively an account as Seinfeld is deadpan .
2 Brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women 's depression .
1 Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .

3 The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .
2 As Warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years .
1 It should have stayed there .
0 ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
0 It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
1 There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .
3 There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .
4 Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .
0 This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .
1 As saccharine as it is disposable .
4 Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics .

4 An exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama .
1 Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
4 Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .
3 She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit .
3 Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed .
1 So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .
4 Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .
1 The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
2 The cast comes through even when the movie does n't .
3 A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .
3 It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .
2 Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .
0 But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .
1 But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
4 I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .
2 Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
1 One Hour Photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director Mark Romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .
2 With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .
1 A processed comedy chop suey .
3 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .
1 Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
3 So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride .
4 An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist -LRB- not to mention gently political -RRB- meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement .
0 I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
4 A sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in Renaissance Spain , and the fact that it 's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling .
3 The Santa Clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .
0 Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .
3 It 's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth .
3 Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .
1 Goes on and on to the point of nausea .
2 -LRB- Raimi 's -RRB- matured quite a bit with Spider-Man , even though it 's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you 'll ever see .
1 It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .
1 An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .
3 In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
3 A modestly surprising movie .
4 ... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .
3 Combines improbable melodrama -LRB- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -RRB- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .
3 This is one of Mr. Chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny .

1 If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''
1 Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .

0 ` This movie sucks . '
1 Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
1 A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .
1 The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
3 What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .
4 The film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .
2 Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time
2 One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .

1 Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
3 A small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .
2 Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
0 While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
3 The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .

3 A compelling allegory about the last days of Germany 's democratic Weimar Republic .

3 Triple X is a double agent , and he 's one bad dude .
3 There has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but Peter Mattei 's Love in the Time of Money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive -LRB- if tragic -RRB- note .
3 This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential
4 As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .
1 Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
3 The filmmakers ' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls ' environment .
2 It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .

3 Enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers .

3 Evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking .
4 All three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly Balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents .
2 The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
3 You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .
1 The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
1 Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .
4 So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted Rembrandt .
1 Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
0 In other words , it 's badder than bad .
0 Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .
1 Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .

4 Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade .
3 With an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera
2 You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .
1 A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .
1 Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .
2 If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
0 So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
2 Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
0 Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .
3 The Hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame .
3 Delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information .
2 Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .
4 -LRB- Dong -RRB- makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets you riled up .
4 Light the candles , bring out the cake and do n't fret about the calories because there 's precious little substance in Birthday Girl -- it 's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .
4 In his debut as a director , Washington has a sure hand .
4 -- but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I 've had in a while .
2 This is not Chabrol 's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer .
3 The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death .
4 It 's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffith made in the early days of silent film .
1 The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
4 The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
2 If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .
3 When all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , I trust , will you .
3 It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
3 Director Claude Chabrol has become the master of innuendo .
3 Woven together handsomely , recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from Lonely Boy to Do n't Look Back .
0 It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
1 Paul Cox needed to show it .
2 A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .
3 The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .
1 They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .
3 moved
0 Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .
2 A piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .
4 This movie is to be cherished .
4 The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have loved it .
1 Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
4 While Tattoo borrows heavily from both Seven and The Silence of the Lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .
1 Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
3 The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .
3 Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , Scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting .
1 While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .
3 Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''
4 A real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .
2 Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine .
2 Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .
4 Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .
0 Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .
4 I 'd watch these two together again in a New York minute .

4 Ferrara 's best film in years .
2 Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .

4 Poetry in motion captured on film .
1 Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .
1 None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...
1 Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .
2 It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists .

3 Really is a pan-American movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart .
2 Same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse .
1 The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead -LRB- water -RRB- weight of the other .
2 Crikey indeed .
2 It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
1 It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
0 You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
3 A stirring road movie .
3 If you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart .
3 It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .

4 Perhaps the best sports movie I 've ever seen .
1 Just send it to Cranky .
1 Steven Soderbergh does n't remake Andrei Tarkovsky 's Solaris so much as distill it .
1 Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
1 In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
1 Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .
2 New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...
1 Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .
1 With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .
1 Van Wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest .
1 No , even that 's too committed .
4 The large-frame IMAX camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .

3 dramatic snapshot
2 What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .
3 It 'll keep you wide awake and ... very tense .
1 The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .
3 It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .
3 Less an examination of neo-Nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .
4 Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works , Invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .
3 While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
3 There are no special effects , and no Hollywood endings .
1 Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
3 Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
4 From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .
2 The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
3 A stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help Chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact .
3 Fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy .
3 It 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .
4 You can sip your vintage wines and watch your Merchant Ivory productions ; I 'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a Jerry Bruckheimer flick any day of the week .
3 A quiet , disquieting triumph .
0 A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms .
2 It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
3 Hugely accomplished slice of Hitchcockian suspense .
1 A generic international version of a typical American horror film .
2 The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .
4 Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .
3 Charlotte Sometimes is a gem .
3 Stage director Sam Mendes showcases Tom Hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge .

3 Essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty .
1 A cartoon ?
2 Disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical `` Bedknobs and Broomsticks , '' which also dealt with British children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime .
1 These guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers .
0 It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .
3 The Powerpuff Girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact .
1 Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .
3 I love the opening scenes of a wintry New York City in 1899 .
3 If -LRB- Jaglom 's -RRB- latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing .
2 It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
4 The movie is a trove of delights .
1 With `` Ichi the Killer '' , Takashi Miike , Japan 's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than Batman ...
2 Were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about Cal than does the movie or the character any good , Freundlich 's World Traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising American movies of the year .
2 Thin period piece .
4 A well-executed spy-thriller .
2 The stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt .
3 ... the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with Musset unfolds as Sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form .
0 More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
2 Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .

1 ... one resurrection too many .
0 Execrable .
3 It may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer .
3 I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
3 -LRB- Allen 's -RRB- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-America diversions could ever be .
1 It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
2 Bernal and
2 An ambitious and moving but bleak film .
3 If cinema had been around to capture the chaos of France in the 1790 's , one imagines the result would look like something like this .
3 Slight but enjoyable documentary .
2 Did the film inform and educate me ?
1 If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .

2 All the actors are good in Pauline & Paulette but van der Groen , described as ` Belgium 's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as Pauline .
2 Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary .
3 ` Yes , that 's right : it 's Forrest Gump , Angel Of Death . '
3 Metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story .
1 Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
1 This Orange has some juice , but it 's far from fresh-squeezed .
3 By not averting his eyes , Solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable .
3 A remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive Eisenhower era about one suburban woman 's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life .
1 Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .
1 The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
1 Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack .
2 Or else a doggie winks .
3 You need n't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of Haynes ' work .
2 Decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like .
4 More than anything else , Kissing Jessica Stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake Sleepless in Seattle again and again .
3 Fast and funny , an action cartoon that 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd .
2 After all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .
4 Not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season .
2 Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .
1 A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
3 Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
3 Here is a VH1 Behind the Music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that did n't sell many records but helped change a nation .
4 Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .
1 After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .

3 Maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts .
3 From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
2 Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .
1 The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
1 Were Dylan Thomas alive to witness first-time director Ethan Hawke 's strained Chelsea Walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Theatre . '
3 Affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with Spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together .
2 A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .
1 It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .

1 A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
1 The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
1 An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .
2 It will break your heart many times over .
1 This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
1 It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
1 Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before .
1 -LRB- A -RRB- mess .
0 A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
3 The sword fighting is well done and Auteuil is a goofy pleasure .
1 a stereotype
4 The IMAX screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation .
2 Kaufman and Jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
3 God bless Crudup and his aversion to taking the easy Hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness .
1 Is it a comedy ?
3 Unlike most surf movies , Blue Crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave .

3 Carrying off a spot-on Scottish burr , Duvall -LRB- also a producer -RRB- peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper .
2 A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .
4 Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .
0 Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
2 Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .
3 Unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from France .

3 Probably the best case for Christianity since Chesterton and Lewis .
0 Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end .

0 No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
4 -LRB- Ramsay -RRB- visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor .

1 The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .
0 Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
4 This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .
1 Consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director I admire .
3 The subtitled costume drama is set in a remote African empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow .
2 Opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half .
4 A captivating new film .
2 If you adored The Full Monty so resoundingly that you 're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .
3 Worth catching for Griffiths ' warm and winning central performance .
1 Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
2 While this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that 's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .
3 Davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as Amy .
0 An uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , The Grey Zone does have a center , though a morbid one .
1 The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .
0 So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .
3 Satin Rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it 's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .
3 A pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties .
3 Another trumpet blast that there may be a New Mexican Cinema a-bornin ' . '
1 Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .
1 Only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of Elizabeth Berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm .
1 Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .
0 Collateral Damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it were n't .
2 When you think you 've figured out Bielinsky 's great game , that 's when you 're in the most trouble : He 's the con , and you 're just the mark .
4 Swimming is above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds .
2 It 's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .

2 The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer 's putrid pond of retread action twaddle .

1 Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !
2 The whole affair is as predictable as can be .
3 The film is a very good viewing alternative for young women .
3 To those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer 's ` Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood , ' but that 's not saying much .
3 But it also has many of the things that made the first one charming .

3 This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon .
3 But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
3 About Schmidt is Nicholson 's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing King Lear .
1 It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
4 This is a very funny , heartwarming film .
3 It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .
4 I was amused and entertained by the unfolding of Bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .
3 For most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche .
1 With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
1 Being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .
2 The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare .

3 ... enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games .
3 What 's invigorating about it is that it does n't give a damn .
2 Cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .
3 An entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller .

2 Punitively affirmational parable .
1 Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .

3 Star\/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own .
3 This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected .
1 But ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters .
3 Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros .
1 There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .
4 A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work .
2 It pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .
4 The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .
0 It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
3 The creative animation work may not look as fully ` rendered ' as Pixar 's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree .
2 An often unfunny romp .
2 It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
2 Clever but not especially compelling .
1 An EXIT sign , that is .
2 It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .
4 The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .
1 ... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
3 Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .

1 A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours -LRB- and , for that matter , Shrek -RRB- .
3 It 's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .
1 No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .
3 The film exudes the urbane sweetness that Woody Allen seems to have bitterly forsaken .
1 The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
3 Cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle .
0 What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .
0 I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
0 There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
1 I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
3 There 's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to Lau .

0 None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .
2 -- was a fad that had long since vanished .
1 An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
1 Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
2 I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .

2 Solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .
1 Includes too much obvious padding .
2 Well , they 're ` they ' .
1 Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .
4 -LRB- A -RRB- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting .
1 The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
3 For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .
4 The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .
2 As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .
3 Alternately frustrating and rewarding .
2 I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
1 It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
4 Anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .
1 It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
1 -- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .
2 Interesting , but not compelling .
3 `` Catch Me '' feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark .
2 An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .
3 The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react .
2 Eh .
0 Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
2 The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
3 -LRB- Stephen -RRB- Earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have .
1 Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .
1 Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .

1 Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
1 A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .
0 Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
1 To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
4 finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed
2 There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
2 -LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .

4 ... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels .
3 It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
2 Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it 's anti-Catholic .
3 The new Insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .
3 Its sheer dynamism is infectious .
2 Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
0 Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
0 Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls .

1 A light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .
1 They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .

1 Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .
1 The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .

1 ... this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ...
2 You can thank me for this .
1 Despite its Hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of `` Lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage Shirley Temple script .

1 An alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom ... you 'd be wise to send your regrets .
3 The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .
3 Filmmaker Stacy Peralta has a flashy editing style that does n't always jell with Sean Penn 's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it .

4 At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .
0 Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
3 The evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear .
4 Not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .
0 Truly terrible .
4 LaBute masterfully balances both Traditional or Modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other .
1 Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .
1 Anemic , pretentious .
2 If the very concept makes you nervous ... you 'll have an idea of the film 's creepy , scary effectiveness .
1 Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .

1 Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
1 In between all the emotional seesawing , it 's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived .
2 The combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives Italian for Beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .
3 Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means .
3 Good-naturedly cornball sequel .
3 Moonlight Mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy .

1 Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .
2 The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
1 This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
3 Reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` Signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen .
1 The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
1 It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
3 As a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , Sex with Strangers is a success .

2 At its best when the guarded , resentful Betty and the manipulative yet needy Margot are front and center .
3 Director Tom Dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon , but Showtime 's uninspired send-up of TV cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .
2 I wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` Slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but I laughed so much that I did n't mind .
4 Sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy ... Attal looks so much like a young Robert DeNiro that it seems the film should instead be called ` My Husband Is Travis Bickle ' .

4 The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible IMAX sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes .
1 Even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , Spy Kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man .
0 The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .

1 hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
3 It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .

2 Pedro Rodrigues '
3 A college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing !
0 There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
1 All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .

2 There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .
1 Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
3 Though filmed partly in Canada , Paid in Full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the Reagan years .
1 It still feels like a prison stretch .
2 As home movie gone haywire , it 's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , I 'd rather listen to old Tori Amos records .
1 Ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over .
2 In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
0 The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .
2 After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .

1 The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
2 A gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the Iranian new wave .
4 -LRB- A -RRB- real pleasure in its laid-back way .
0 Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .

3 What a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is .
2 Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .

3 A well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .
2 The film truly does rescue -LRB- the Funk Brothers -RRB- from Motown 's shadows .
3 Director Chris Wedge and screenwriters Michael Berg , Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage Looney Tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time .
1 The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
3 A playful Iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences .

1 You can taste it , but there 's no fizz .
0 Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible

2 Renner ?
1 For all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .
2 Trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease .
3 She 's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her Bjorkness .
3 Like many Western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about North Korea 's recent past and South Korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight .
4 The actors are fantastic .
3 It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .
2 The Trinity Assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and George Ratliff 's documentary , Hell House , reflects their earnestness -- which makes for a terrifying film .

1 This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
4 This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .
1 All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .
4 A beautifully observed character piece .
2 Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
0 Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .
3 Does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story .
0 In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .

3 Formuliac , but fun .

0 Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .

3 This deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications .
0 There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .
3 The filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching .

1 Go , girls , right down the reality drain .

3 Funny and touching .
0 There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
